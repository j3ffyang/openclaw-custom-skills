## Overview

This repository hosts two types of automation assets:

**OpenClaw skills** — production-ready agent instruction sets (`SKILL.md`) published to the [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai) registry. Each skill drives an OpenClaw agent through a specific content workflow.

**Claude Code commands** — slash commands (`.claude/commands/`) that extend [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) with project-specific automation. Drop the `.claude/` folder into any project and the commands become available instantly via `/command-name`.

**Key capabilities:**

- Polish and translate technical blog drafts to English (en-US) or Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)
- Generate hero and per-section images with consistent style across posts
- Convert polished content into Astro-compatible markdown with YAML frontmatter
- Produce cinematic MP4 videos from static images via Google Veo
- Create culturally verified Tibetan Buddhist product articles with matched imagery
- Export X/Twitter bookmarks to rich Markdown files for Obsidian, Notion, or any note-taking system

---

## Prerequisites

### For OpenClaw skills

- [OpenClaw CLI](https://openclaw.ai) installed and authenticated

  - Image generation: OpenAI DALL-E-3 or compatible
  - Video generation: Google Veo (via Vertex AI / Gemini API)
  - Vision analysis: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash

## Claude Code Commands

Claude Code commands live in `.claude/commands/` and are invoked as `/command-name` inside any Claude Code session. To use them, clone this repo and copy (or symlink) the `.claude/` folder into your project root.

| Command | Trigger | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`export-twitter-bookmarks`](./.claude/commands/export-twitter-bookmarks.md) | `/export-twitter-bookmarks` | Check for `bookmarks.json`, run the Python exporter, verify output, and report total bookmarks exported with a sample file list |

---

## Installation

### OpenClaw skills — from ClawHub registry

```bash
# Install a single skill
openclaw skill install <skill-name>

# Example
openclaw skill install blog-polish-zhcn
```

### OpenClaw skills — from this repository (local)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/negtivSpaz/custom-skills-for-openclaw-claude.git
cd custom-skills-for-openclaw-claude

# Install a skill from a local path
openclaw skill install ./blog-polish-zhcn
```

### Claude Code commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/negtivSpaz/custom-skills-for-openclaw-claude.git

# Copy the .claude folder into your project
cp -r custom-skills-for-openclaw-claude/.claude /your/project/

# Or use all commands globally
cp -r custom-skills-for-openclaw-claude/.claude ~/.claude
```

Then inside a Claude Code session, type `/export-twitter-bookmarks` (or whichever command) to invoke it.

---

## Usage

### OpenClaw skills

Each skill is invoked through the OpenClaw CLI. Refer to the individual `SKILL.md` for the full input/output contract.

```bash
# Run a skill interactively
openclaw run blog-polish-zhcn

# Pass inputs inline
openclaw run blog-polish-zhcn --input draftPath=./my-draft.md outputDir=./out
```

**Workspace conventions** used across skills:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.openclaw/workspace/tibetanDraft/` | Input drafts for Tibetan Buddhist skills |
| `~/.openclaw/workspace/tibetanProc/` | Processed outputs (articles, images, videos) |

Output filenames follow the pattern `yymmddHHMM_<title>.<ext>` for chronological sorting.

### Claude Code commands

```
/export-twitter-bookmarks
```

Run this inside a Claude Code session from the project root. Claude will guide you through any missing prerequisites.

## Contributing

### Adding an OpenClaw skill

1. Fork this repository and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-skill`
2. Add your skill directory with a valid `SKILL.md`
3. Test locally with `openclaw run ./my-skill`
4. Open a pull request against `main` with a clear description of what the skill does

Skill `SKILL.md` files should declare at minimum: `name`, `version`, `author`, `description`, `inputs`, `outputs`, and a step-by-step `workflow`.

### Adding a Claude Code command

1. Add your command file under `.claude/commands/<command-name>.md`
2. The filename becomes the slash command trigger (e.g., `my-tool.md` → `/my-tool`)
3. Open a pull request with a description and example invocation
