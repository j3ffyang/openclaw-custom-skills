## Overview

This repository hosts production-ready OpenClaw skills published to the [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai) registry. Each skill is a self-contained agent instruction set (`SKILL.md`) that drives an OpenClaw agent through a specific content workflow — from drafting and polishing technical blog posts to generating cinematic Tibetan Buddhist video media.

**Key capabilities:**

- Polish and translate technical blog drafts to English (en-US) or Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)
- Generate hero and per-section images with consistent style across posts
- Convert polished content into Astro-compatible markdown with YAML frontmatter
- Produce cinematic MP4 videos from static images via Google Veo
- Create culturally verified Tibetan Buddhist product articles with matched imagery

---

## Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw CLI](https://openclaw.ai) installed and authenticated
- ClawHub account (for installing registry skills)
- API access as required per skill:
  - Image generation: OpenAI DALL-E-3 or compatible
  - Video generation: Google Veo (via Vertex AI / Gemini API)
  - Vision analysis: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
